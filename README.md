# Allegro
First time creating a videogame to improve my logical skills, not to practice design :D

Inspired by Flappy Bird, but i changed it to a cute airplane.

Is a programm in C++ language using Allegro Library. You can't run the programm because you need images and some others resources, so here is a preview:

I used functions, cicles, and others stuffs to make the airplane moves when you press UP_KEY, because you need to dodge towers and clouds. I added "gravity" and independent background's move
